# Touhou Sokoban!
  This is a small project that I decided to make on my own to learn how to use the Rust programming language on a real release for people to enjoy. I folowed some tutorials on the ggez game engine and forked some projects that were already using it correctly and this helped me learn quite a lot.
  I intend to keep working on this project and update the old dependencies to their newest version soonâ„¢. The codebase will likely change a bit when the dependencies are updated, and some assets will be changed when I have enough knowledge to implement them correctly.

# Credits
#### Olivia
I would like to thank Olivia Ifrim for her comprehensive guide on how to use the ggez game engine. It clarified and helped me learn how to use it, and why each function, method, enum or macro was being used. Do check out her repo on that. Her code examples and books are very comprehensive. https://github.com/iolivia/rust-sokoban
#### Thanh and Ly Nguyen
I would also like to thank Thanh Nguyen and Ly Nguyen for sharing their source code that went in the same direction as Olivia's project, but implemented more features. I'm a Rust beginner and in programming as a whole, so reading their code was essential for me to understand how features such as refreshing the map or reading the map files from a .json files are implemented. It can be considered the code base of this project, and I do intend to maintain it. Do check out their projec: https://github.com/thanhqng1510/sokoban-rust
#### Kazuki Kazuma
Lastly I would like to thank Kazuki Kazuma, my friend for taking some time to make the beautiful assets used in this game. We do intend to keep working together to make more complex assets once I have the skill to implement them in the game.
